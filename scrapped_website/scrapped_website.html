            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>A long long time before time itself had a name there was a foul beast we called Britania!</p>
            <p>One time Britania got extra hungry and decided to take a bite out of poor Ireland and they called it "Nothern Ireland".</p>
            <p>Every single day the citizens of northern Ireland suffer under the rule of the foul beasts!</p>

            <h2>Culture</h2>
            <p>"I'll have one pint" is something a pitiful English geezer would say, but we Irish are not like that.</p>
            <p>Our culture is deep rooted in Welsh and Celtic traditions so we are basically vikings!</p>
            <p>We love to have ourselves a good ol beer and dance in the boozer while playing our harps.</p>

        <li>AI is a myth</li>
        <li>Btw im anyways a better coder than AI so why would i use it Bruh!</li>
        <li>Oh and also i am Fabian the third and i would never use an AI!</li>
        <li>AI is for losers</li>
        <li>AI is for people who cant code</li>
        <li>AI is for people who are too lazy to code</li>
        <li>AI is for people who are too stupid to code</li>
        <li>AI is for people who are too poor to code</li>
        <li>AI is for people who are too rich to code</li>
        <li>AI is for people who are too cool to code</li>
        <li>AI is for people who are too uncool to code</li>
        <li>AI is for people who are too old to code</li>
        <li>AI is for people who are too young to code</li>
        <li>And in conclusion AI is for people who are too much of a coward to code</li>
        <li>AND IM NOT A COWARD!</li>
        <li>Thats why i did not use AI but you might wonder why i wrote so much about AI?</li>
        <li>Well its because i am Fabian the third and i can do whatever i want!</li>
        <li>But its also because a man on the street said that i could not code when i showed him this website!</li>
        <li>So i showed him!</li>
        <li>And now he is my biggest fan!</li>
        <li>So if you ever hear someone say that i used AI to make this website just show them this list!</li>
        <li>And if they still dont believe you just tell them to go to hell!</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
