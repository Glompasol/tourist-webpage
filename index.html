  <h3>The History of Ireland</h3>
  <p>
    Ireland's story is one of resilience and endurance, and even in tough times the Irish have always found a way to celebrate life whether its through music, dance, or a good pint of Guinness.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before christianity the celtic lived in Ireland. Consisting of many different tribes the celtic were known for being warriors like the vikings who later invaded Ireland in the 8th-11th centuries and made settlements. These viking camps would go on to become Ireland's largest coastal cities including Dublin its capital.
  </p>
  <p>

    In 1155 the normans invaded Ireland marking the start of a 800 year period of Britsh rule. Ireland under british rule would find itself often getting involved in conflicts such as the wars of the three kingdoms which resulted in more than 220 000 Irish deaths. Furthermore Ireland had numerous famines but the most devastating was the great famine of 1845 which killed more than one million people and forced another million to emigrate taking away 1/4 of the population.
  </p>
  <p>

    In the 20th century the Irish would see a surge of nationalism and a desire for independence with the Easter rising of 1916. Although the rising was quickly crushed this would inspire many to join the fight and initiated the Irish war of independence from 1919-1921 and would force the british to create a treaty giving Ireland dominion status. However this would lead to the Irish civil war between those who supported the treaty and those who opposed it.
