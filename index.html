            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>A long long time before time itself had a name there was a foul beast we called Britania!</p>
            <p>One time Britania got extra hungry and decided to take a bite out of poor Ireland and they called it "Nothern Ireland".</p>
            <p>Every single day the citizens of northern Ireland suffer under the rule of the foul beasts!</p>

            <h2>Culture</h2>
            <p>"I'll have one pint" is something a pitiful English geezer would say, but we Irish are not like that.</p>
            <p>Our culture is deep rooted in Welsh and Celtic traditions so we are basically vikings!</p>
            <p>We love to have ourselves a good ol beer and dance in the boozer while playing our harps.</p>
